## 👨‍💻 Development

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to develop PartPilot:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (Version: >=18.x)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - to run PostgreSQL

### Setup

Excited to have you onboard! Lets get you started.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
First things first, let's get the code on your machine. Open up your terminal and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/PartPilotLab/PartPilot.git
cd PartPilot
```

**Step 2: Spin Up Docker**
With Docker, you don't need to worry about setting up Next.js or PostgreSQL manually. We've got a docker-compose.yml file that will do the heavy lifting for you.
Run the following command to build and start your containers:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
This command kicks off the magic. It'll pull in the necessary images, set up your database, and get the Next.js app running. It's like hitting the power button on your awesome electronics workstation!

**Step 3: Check It Out**
Once Docker has done its thing, your PartPilot should be up and running. Open your favorite browser and head to http://localhost:3000. Voilà! You should see the PartPilot homepage smiling back at you.

**Step 4: Make It Your Own**
Now that you're up and running, it's time to explore! Add some parts, link them to projects, play around with the barcode scanner feature, and see what PartPilot can do.
